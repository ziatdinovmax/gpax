def index_kernel(indices1, indices2, params):
    r"""
    Computes the task kernel matrix for given task indices.
    The task covariance between two discrete indices i and j
    is calculated as:

    .. math::
        task\_kernel_values[i, j] = WW^T[i, j] + v[i] \delta_{ij}

    where :math:`WW^T` is the matrix product of :math:`B` with its transpose, :math:`v[i]`
    is the variance of task :math:`i`, and :math:`\delta_{ij}` is the Kronecker delta
    which is 1 if :math:`i == j` and 0 otherwise.

    Args:
        indices1:
            An array of task indices for the first set of data points.
            Each entry is an integer that indicates the task associated
            with a data point.
        indices2:
            An array of task indices for the second set of data points.
            Each entry is an integer that indicates the task associated
            with a data point.
        params:
            Dictionary of parameters for the task kernel. It includes:
            'W': The coregionalization matrix of shape (num_tasks, num_tasks).
                This is a symmetric positive  semi-definite matrix that determines
                the correlation structure between the tasks.
            'v':
                The vector of task variances with the (n_tasks,) shape.
                This is a diagonal matrix that  determines the variance of each task.

    Returns:
        Computed kernel matrix of the shape (len(indices1), len(indices2)).
        Each entry task_kernel_values[i, j] is the covariance between the tasks
        associated with data point i in indices1 and data point j in indices2.
