    Expected Improvement

    Given a probabilistic model :math:`m` that models the objective function :math:`f`,

        \end{cases}

    where :math:`\mu(x)` is the predictive mean, :math:`\sigma(x)` is the predictive standard deviation,
    :math:`f^+` is the value of the best observed sample. :math:`Z` is defined as:

    .. math::

        Z = \frac{\mu(x) - f^+}{\sigma(x)}

    provided :math:`\sigma(x) > 0`.

    In the case of HMC, the function leverages multiple predictive posteriors, each associated
    with a different HMC sample of the GP model parameters, to capture both prediction uncertainty
    and hyperparameter uncertainty. In this setup, the uncertainty in parameters of probabilistic
    mean function (if any) also contributes to the acquisition function values.

    Args:

        best_f:
            Best function value observed so far. Derived from the predictive mean
            when not provided by a user.

        noiseless:
            Noise-free prediction. It is set to False by default as new/unseen data is assumed
            to follow the same distribution as the training data. Hence, since we introduce a model noise
            for the training data, we also want to include that noise in our prediction.
        penalty:
